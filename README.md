# Metrix

## How can I add Metrix to my server?
First and foremost, Metrix is sort of private. Additionally, Metrix does not support self-hosting without alot of setup, so running a copy yourself is not recommended. \n
If you believe that Metrix is a bot that would fulfill your server's needs, you may invite the bot [here][metrix-invite].

## About this repository
The code here is strictly an example (Currently, it is outdated code). Running this code on your own is not supported; I will not be providing the resources necessary to self-host.
